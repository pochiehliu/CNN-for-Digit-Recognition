## Persoanl Prohect: Digit recognition

This personal project is trying to apply two simple algorithm, kNN and SVM, on digit recognition as a baseline model. Then build  convolutional neural network (CNN) using numpy on same dataset.

### Steps

1. Apply visulization techniques to investigae MNIST data
2. Implement kNN and SVM algorithm
3. Implement NN algorithm using numpy
4. Implement NN using Affine layer structure
5. Add regulation term
6. Add convolution filter feature
