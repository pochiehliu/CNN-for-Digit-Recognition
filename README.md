## Persoanl Prohect: Digit recognition

This personal project is trying to apply two simple algorithm, kNN and SVM, on digit recognition as a baseline model. Then apply convolutional neural network (CNN) on same problem.

### Steps

1. Apply visulization techniques to investigae MNIST data
2. Implement kNN and SVM algorithm
3. Implement CNN algorithm
