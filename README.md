## Persoanl Prohect: Digit recognition

This personal project is focusing on building convolutional neural network (CNN) using numpy in python for recognizing hand written digits. Two simple algorithms, kNN and SVM, were applied as baseline models. 

### Steps

1. Apply visulization techniques to investigae MNIST data
2. Implement kNN and SVM algorithm
3. Implement NN algorithm using numpy
4. Implement NN using Affine layer structure
5. Implement optimizers (SGD, Momentum, AdaGrad, Adam, RMSprop)
6. Add suggested initial weights (Xavier and He) and dropout feature
7. Add convolution filter feature
